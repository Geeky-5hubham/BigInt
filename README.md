# BigInt Class Implementation in C++

This project implements a BigInt class in C++ to handle arbitrarily large integers. The BigInt class supports various arithmetic operations, comparison operations, and utility functions.

## Features

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Exponentiation.
- **Comparison Operations**: Equality, Inequality, Greater than, Less than, Greater than or equal to, Less than or equal to.
- **Utility Functions**: Length of BigInt, Null check, Access digit by index.

## Implemented Functions

- **Factorial**: Computes factorial of integers 
- **Square Root**: Computes Square root of BigInt.
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: Computes Fibonacci numbers

## Usage

This project includes a main.cpp file demonstrating the usage of the BigInt class and its functions. It calculates various operations and prints results.

## How to Run

1. Compile the project using a C++ compiler.
2. Execute the compiled binary.
3. See the output demonstrating BigInt operations, Fibonacci sequence, Catalan number, and factorial calculations.
